Flist is my personal open-source project. It is intended to help you (user) in keeping all your social contacts at one place so you can easily share them at once with people you meet. The platform allows you to create a profile, which you then fill with the list of any contacts that you want to share; from large social networks such as Facebook, to emails and phone numbers, and to your profiles at small thematic forums. In short, you create your own profile in the online contact book.
